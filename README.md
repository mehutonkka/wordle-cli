# wordle-cli
Wordle game with python + in future a cli

Letters that have not been used and could be used are shown in the bottom right

When launching, put -bonsai at the the end to get the bonsai ascii art. The bonsai will gain more green as you get more letter's correct.

When launching, put -letters at the end to get helping actual letters ('a', 'b', 'c'...) next to the ASCII letter arts.

Terminal resizes automatically on Windows atleast.

Writing is done by keyboard inputs rather than previously by python's input field: 
- ENTER: confirm guess
- BACKSPACE: self explanatory
- ESC: end game
- English alphabets to write
